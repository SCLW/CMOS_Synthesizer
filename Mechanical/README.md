# Dimensions and Baseplate

This folder contains alls mechanical information and files for laser cutting the baseplate for the synth.

Note: In this revision, the two central mounting holes are not perfectly centered—they are offset by about 1 mm. This was an oversight in the layout process but does not affect assembly or stability. The dimension drawing below reflects the actual positions.
